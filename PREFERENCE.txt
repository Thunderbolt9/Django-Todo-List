In my opinion, For large applications, I find Django framework easy to work with as it provides us with various 
built-in features like a ready-to-use admin panel, built-in template engine that saves a lot of development time, 
also we can divide the whole project into small applications which helps us in maintaining the project efficiently. 

But for Smaller applications I would choose flask, to avoid so many unnecessary features.
